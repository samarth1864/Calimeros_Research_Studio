# Calimeros_Research_Studio

The project explores innovative ways to address Barcelona’s sustainability challenges, such as carbon emissions, air pollution, and energy inefficiency.
By leveraging AI, IoT sensors, and Nature-Based Solutions (NBS), the project aims to optimize municipal budgets for interventions that transform underutilized urban spaces into productive assets.

The study highlights solutions like urban farming, greenery, and solar catchment systems, evaluated for cost-efficiency and environmental impact.
A custom dashboard provides planners with actionable insights and tools to prioritize interventions, aligning with Barcelona’s Climate Plan and contributing to a 45% CO₂ reduction by 2030.

This initiative offers a scalable and data-driven framework for sustainable urban transformation.
